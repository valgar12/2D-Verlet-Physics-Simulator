# 2D Verlet Physics Simulator

**A 2-month project: a 2D particle-based physics simulator implemented with Verlet Integration, rendered with Dear ImGui + DirectX11.**

This project was built to learn physics engines and level up C++ skills. It features a full ImGui control panel (open with `Insert`) for live tuning, a spatial grid for efficient collision detection, and grid partitioning to enable multithreading.

## üéØ Features

* **Verlet Integration** for stable constraint solving and particle-based simulation.
* **Real-time ImGui control panel** (open with `Insert`) with many options for gravity, elasticity, shapes, and debug visuals.
* **Spatial grid collision detection** ‚Äî collisions checked only when 2+ balls share the same grid cell.
* **Grid partitioning** to split work for multithreading (collision/resolution).
* **Resizable window** ‚Äî particles adapt to new borders.
* **High performance** ‚Äî supports roughly **~10k particles** at **~60 FPS** on capable hardware.
* **Interactive particle manipulation** ‚Äî click & drag the nearest particle.

* **`Space`** ‚Äî Clear all particles
* **`F1`** ‚Äî Freeze / stop all particles
* **Left mouse (hold)** ‚Äî Move the nearest particle to the mouse and drag it
* Resize window ‚Äî particles adapt to borders

## ‚ö° Performance

* Approx **10,000 particles** at **~60 FPS** on suitable hardware (CPU/GPU dependent).
* Spatial grid drastically reduces pairwise collision checks.
* Grid partitioning enables parallel processing of collision and resolution steps.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Notes

* Occasionally particles may **go crazy** (sudden very high velocities). **Press `Space`** to clear all particles and resolve the issue.
* **Grid cell size = 5.** If you spawn balls larger than size 5, collision detection behaves poorly and instability becomes more frequent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build / Run (suggested)

1. Build with a Windows C++ toolchain (Visual Studio recommended for DirectX11).
2. Link Dear ImGui with the DirectX11 backend.
3. Run the executable and press `Insert` to open the ImGui panel.
